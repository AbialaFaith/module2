                    <p><b>Steps</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start by sauteeing the Onions. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout.</li>
                        <li>Add the ginger and garlic and cook along with the tomato paste for another two minutes.</li>
                        <li>Add the blended peppers.Fry until the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and the sauce no longer smells raw. It would take maybe 15 to 20 minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended pepper.</li>
                        <li>Finally, in building flavor, add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but optional), and seasoning cubes. Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to.</li>
                        <li>Once the flavor is on point, then, stir in the Rice. Make sure you stir the rice properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce.</li>
                        <li>Now add water or chicken stock, if you have any. Give it a brief stir and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of steam in order to turn out well.</li>
                        <li>Once the rice comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low immediately and continue to cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>And now, Jollof Rice is ready! Serve with any protein of your choice</li>

                    <p><b>Steps</b></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash all the vegetables to be used, cut in preferred shapes and sizes, and set them aside.</li>
                        <li>Cook the cow liver until done and cut into tiny pieces. Cook the chicken until tender and grill in an overn or fry, as you prefer.</li>
                        <li>Parboil the rice A well parboiled rice ensures that the grains of the rice will not stick together when the rice is done. Rinse the parboiled rice with cold water and put in a sieve so all the water drains out.</li>
                        <li>Pour the chicken stock into a pot and set to boil. Once the water boils, add the parboiled rice. Also, add 1 tablespoon of plain yellow curry powder, then add salt to taste.</li>
                        <li>Add water if needed. The water level should be slightly less than the level of the rice; at most it should be at the same level as the rice. This is to ensure that all the water dries up by the time the rice is cooked and that the rice is not over cooked.</li>
                        <li>Once the water has dried up, the rice should be cooked perfectly.</li>
                        <li>Now pour a small amount of vegetable oil into a frying pan. When the oil is hot, add 1 part of diced onions and stir for 10 seconds, followed by 1 part of diced cow liver, one part each of the diced vegetables, then 1 part of cooked rice.</li>
                        <li>Add more salt if necessary. More curry powder may also be added at this stage if you need to touch up on the colour. Stir till all the ingredients have mixed well and transfer to a dry pot. Repeat this for the remaining batches of the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>The fried rice is ready! Serve with grilled or fried chicken.</li>

                <p><b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></p>
                <p>To make the dough: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large bowl mix together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. Add cubed butter and rub it with the flour until you get a crumbly texture.</li>
                    <li>Beat 2 eggs with cold water and add it to the flour mixture, mix until dough is formed. Do not over mix! Wrap the dough with cling film and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To make the filling: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large pan heat oil. Add onion and sauté for 5-6 minutes, until translucent. Add diced carrots and cook for 3-4 minutes. Add the meat and cook, breaking it apart, for 4-5 minutes, until no longer pink. Season with salt, pepper, thyme and flour. stir and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
                    <li>Add in cubed potatoes stir well. Pour in the water/broth. Stir.</li>
                    <li>Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes, until thickens. Set aside to cool.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350F (175C).</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into 2-4 pieces (you also can roll the whole dough, dividing it just making it easier to work). Roll out the dough into 1/8-inch (1/4 cm) thickness. Cut out a round shape with your desired sized. Combine all the leftover dough and roll it again to make more circles.</li>
                    <li>Place about 1-2 tablespoons of the meat mixture in the center, brush the edges with water and fold over the dough. Seal it with your fingers or with a fork. Poke the pies with a fork to create a steam outlet while baking brush the pies with beaten egg.</li>
                    <li>Bake for 25-30 minutes, until golden. Cool slightly before serving.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>600 g all-purpose flour</li> 
                    <li>10 g fast action yeast</li>    
                    <li>150 g sugar use as desired</li>    
                    <li>½ tsp salt</li>    
                    <li>550-650 ml Lukewarm Water</li>    
                    <li>1 tablespoon chilli flakes substitute with 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>    
                    <li>1 teaspoon grated nutmeg (optional)</li>    
                    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a shallow bowl, add flour and salt together (combine salt with flour first)</li>
                    <li>Add other dry ingredients and combine well</li>
                    <li>Add lukewarm water to the dry mixture in bits to form a batter. You can add 500g at first then check if it needs more water. (the batter should not be runny and it shouldn't be thick as well, find a balance in between the two)</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl with a cling film or a damp towel and place in a warm place to proof. (Till batter doubles in size usually between an hour or two. You can leave it longer if you want)</li>
                    <li>Once the mixture has risen and doubled in size, you then move on to frying.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>How to Fry: </b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>On medium-high heat, add enough oil to a frying pan and heat till hot (about 4 inches high). Drop a tiny bit of batter in hot oil to test and if the batter floats to the top of the heat then it is ready to use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Method on how to scoop batter to oil with your palm: </strong> People always find scooping batter in oil very tricky but I tell you it is very easy:
                        <p>Get clean water in a bowl</p>
                        <p>Dip your hand in the water to wet it a bit, shake off excess</p>
                        <p>Dip your hand in batter, draw the batter towards the bowl and yourself</p>
                        <p>Keep the batter in between your fingers and palm</p>
                        <p>Squeeze batter in-between your palm and allow it to drop freely into the oil</p>
                        <p>Don’t overcrowd the oil</p></li>
                    <li>The batter should float to the top of the oil, this is where the magic start, I just love the bits when the puff puff starts turning in the hot oil (reduce the heat a bit at this point so that puff puff can fry through and be well done)</li>
                    <li>Fry puff puff on both sides till golden brown</li>
                    <li>Repeat the process till you have exhausted the batter</li>
                    <li>If the hand method is not for you, simply use a scoop to put the batter in oil.</li>
